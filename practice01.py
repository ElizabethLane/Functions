# PART TWO

# 1. (a) Write a function, `is_berry()`, which takes a fruit name as a string
#        and returns a boolean if the fruit is a "strawberry", "cherry", or 
#        "blackberry".

#    (b) Write another function, shipping_cost(), which calculates shipping cost
#        by taking a fruit name as a string, calling the `is_berry()` function 
#        within the `shipping_cost()` function and returns `0` if ``is_berry()
#        == True``, and `5` if ``is_berry() == False``.

# 2. (a) Write a function, `is_hometown()`, which takes a town name as a string
#        and evaluates to `True` if it is your hometown, and `False` otherwise.
#
#    (b) Write a function, `full_name()`, which takes a first and last name as
#        arguments as strings and returns the concatenation of the two names in
#        one string.
#
#    (c) Write a function, `hometown_greeting()`, which takes a home town, a
#        first name, and a last name as strings as arguments, calls both
#        `is_hometown()` and `full_name()` and prints "Hi, 'full name here',
#        we're from the same place!", or "Hi 'full name here', where are you 
#        from?" depending on what `is_hometown()` evaluates to.
